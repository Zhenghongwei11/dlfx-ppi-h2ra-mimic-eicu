# Literature Benchmark (Writing + Positioning)

Goal: benchmark recent high-impact (Q1/Q2) papers and guidelines to calibrate structure, reporting depth, and limitation language for an ICU SUP comparative effectiveness cohort study (PPI vs H2RA) with external validation.

## Peer Papers / Guidelines (minimum set)

1) **PEPTIC randomized clinical trial (pragmatic cluster crossover)**
   - Citation: PEPTIC Investigators et al. *JAMA* (2020). “Effect of Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis With Proton Pump Inhibitors vs Histamine-2 Receptor Blockers on In-Hospital Mortality Among ICU Patients Receiving Invasive Mechanical Ventilation.”
   - Identifier: PMID 31950977; (see PubMed record)
   - Why it matters: directly compares PPI vs H2RA strategies; provides editor/reviewer baseline expectations for outcomes (CIGIB, CDI, mortality) and reporting style.

2) **BMJ clinical practice guideline for stress ulcer prophylaxis**
   - Citation: *BMJ* (2019/2020). “Gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis for critically ill patients: a clinical practice guideline.”
   - Identifier: BMJ 368:l6722
   - Why it matters: positions current practice and strength of recommendations; frames why real-world evidence still matters and what is clinically meaningful.

3) **Systematic review/meta-analysis of cohort studies (real-world evidence)**
   - Citation: He N et al. *Annals of Pharmacotherapy* (2022). “Are Proton Pump Inhibitors More Effective Than Histamine-2-Receptor Antagonists for Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in Critically Ill Patients? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies.”
   - Identifier: PMID 34971320
   - Why it matters: demonstrates typical confounding concerns and narrative framing for observational comparisons; highlights reviewer sensitivities around causal language.

## Q1 Anchor Paper Deep Read (tactics to borrow)

Anchor: **PEPTIC (JAMA 2020)**.

Writing tactics to copy into our manuscript:
- **Abstract compression:** one sentence each for objective, design/data, primary endpoint, and main estimate; avoid secondary-method digressions.
- **Results paragraph structure:** start with cohort size and adherence/exposure definition clarity; then primary endpoint estimate; then key secondary endpoints; then sensitivity/robustness.
- **Limitations style:** specific threats + what was done to mitigate them (not generic disclaimers); separate “measurement limitations” from “confounding limitations”.
- **Interpretation discipline:** avoid recommendation language unless directly supported by design; explicitly describe what would change the conclusion (e.g., improved endpoint validation, alternative outcome definitions).

Revision checklist (apply before final submission):
- Verify that each Results paragraph contains: finding + magnitude/CI + anchor (Figure/Table/Source Data label).
- Ensure pooled results are reported only for compatible estimands (HR with HR; RR with RR).
- Ensure the Discussion does not imply guideline-level recommendations; emphasize hypothesis-generating nature when residual confounding remains plausible.
