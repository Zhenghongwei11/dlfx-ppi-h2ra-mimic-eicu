# Claim Language Checklist (Cohort Target Trial Emulation)

Use this checklist during the Auditor pass to reduce rejection risk from overclaiming.

## Global
- [x] Title/Abstract use observational language (e.g., “association”, “comparative effectiveness in routine data”) and avoid “proved”, “demonstrated causality”, “superior”.
- [x] No clinical recommendation/guideline language (“should”, “recommend”, “preferred”) unless explicitly justified beyond this study design.
- [x] Every key quantitative statement cites a Figure/Table/Source Data label (not internal paths).

## Primary claim: strict CIGIB
- [x] Language stays within: “associated with” / “consistent with a causal effect under target trial emulation assumptions”.
- [x] Explicitly mentions residual confounding and outcome ascertainment limits.
- [x] Reports effect size with uncertainty (HR and 95% CI) plus a short absolute-risk statement.

## External validation
- [x] States eICU is an external validation cohort and discusses mapping/measurement differences.
- [x] Avoids implying that external validation proves causality; it supports robustness/transportability.

## Sensitivity analyses
- [x] Sensitivity results are described as robustness checks, not as confirmation.
- [x] Negative-control results (if non-null) are discussed as evidence of residual confounding.
