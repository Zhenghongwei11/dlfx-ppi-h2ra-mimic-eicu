# Effect Size Checklist (Submission Draft)

Goal: ensure the manuscript reports **effect sizes with uncertainty** (and key absolute-risk context) for each main outcome, and that every number maps to submission-facing evidence labels.

## Primary outcome: strict CIGIB (14 days)
- [x] Text reports HR with 95% CI for MIMIC (Source Data 1; Figure 3).
- [x] Text reports HR with 95% CI for eICU (Source Data 1; Figure 3).
- [x] Text reports pooled HR with 95% CI (Source Data 1; Figure 3), only if effect measures are compatible.
- [x] Text includes an absolute-risk context statement at 14 days (risk_treated, risk_control, and RD), noting CIs for absolute risks are not computed in this scaffold (Source Data 1).

## Secondary outcome: mortality (28 days)
- [x] Text reports HR with 95% CI per cohort (Source Data 1; Figure 3).
- [x] If a pooled estimate is reported, it is described with heterogeneity caveats (Source Data 1).
- [x] Text includes an absolute-risk context statement at 28 days (risk_treated, risk_control, and RD), noting CI limitations (Source Data 1).

## Secondary outcome: CDI (14 days)
- [x] Text reports RR with 95% CI for MIMIC (Source Data 1; Figure 3 or Supplement Table S2).
- [x] Text explicitly states if eICU CDI is not estimable due to zero events (Source Data 1; Supplement Table S2).
- [x] No pooled CDI estimate is reported when one cohort is non-estimable.

## Broad UGIB (14 days; secondary/exploratory)
- [x] If reported, effect measure is described correctly per cohort (RR vs HR depending on available timing) and not pooled across estimands.

## Robustness and sensitivity analyses
- [x] Figure 4 text reports sensitivity results as robustness checks with a short numeric range for the primary endpoint (Source Data 6).
- [x] Competing-risk effect measure is labeled as CIF-RR and not mixed with HR (Source Data 6; Figure 4).
- [x] Negative-control window is described as a falsification test (not “supporting causality”) (Source Data 6; Supplement).
