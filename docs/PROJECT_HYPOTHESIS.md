# Project Hypothesis (ICU SUP: PPI vs H2RA)

## Primary hypothesis
Among adult ICU patients who meet stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) high-risk indications, initiating a PPI (vs an H2RA) within the first 24 hours of ICU stay changes the 14-day risk of clinically important upper GI bleeding (CIGIB).

## Key testable claims (high level)
1) Comparative effectiveness on CIGIB (strict and broad definitions).
2) Comparative safety on *C. difficile* infection (CDI).
3) Comparative effect on mortality (28-day or in-hospital), with external validation in eICU.

## Definitions
See `protocol/protocol.md` and `protocol/codebook.md` for fixed windows, code lists, and analysis details.
